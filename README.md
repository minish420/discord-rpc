Discord RPC

- How to install - 

Download both .lua files and get any IDE if you havent already got one (IDE example: Visual Studio Code).
Next, create an application in discord with the name and icons of your choice. Put the application ID of 
your discord app into the code with the "client ID (int)" on the side. Next, you may edit this code in any
way you like and customise it.

! Have fun experimenting !
